; Browser Organizer — native host installer (Windows / Inno Setup)
;
; TOOLCHAIN: Inno Setup 6+ (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). Compile with:
;   iscc installer\windows\browser-organizer.iss
; produces dist\BrowserOrganizerSetup.exe.
;
; This script is NOT run in the CI-less / offline sandbox — it requires the Inno
; Setup compiler (iscc.exe), which only runs on Windows. It is built on a
; windows-latest runner (see .github/workflows/release-host.yml) or by a
; maintainer. It expects the SEA binary from `npm run build:sea` at
; dist\host\browser-organizer-host.exe.
;
; What it does (per-user, no admin/elevation):
;   1. Copies browser-organizer-host.exe to %LOCALAPPDATA%\BrowserOrganizer\.
;   2. Runs `browser-organizer-host.exe --install chrome,edge` so the binary
;      writes the HKCU native-messaging registry keys pointing at itself.
;   3. On uninstall, runs `--uninstall chrome,edge` to remove them.

WelcomeLabel2=Browser Organizer Host is a small local helper for the Browser Organizer extension in Chrome and Edge.%n%nThe extension cannot run AI features on its own. This helper runs the AI backend you choose (a local AI CLI or an OpenAI-compatible API) here on your computer and returns the results, so your tabs and bookmarks stay on this machine.%n%nIt installs for your account only (no administrator rights) and registers itself with Chrome and Edge.
FinishedLabel=Browser Organizer Host is installed and registered with Chrome and Edge.%n%nTo finish: open the extension's side panel, click the reload icon, then choose your AI backend under Settings.
